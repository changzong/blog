Hi there! My name is Zong Chang(family name first!). I grew up in a beautiful city in northern China. Then I got my engineering academic background in a wonderful univerisity(HIT). After four years of colurful life, I went to the United Kingdom and got my master degree in the University of Edinburgh, in data science and natural language processing. I really enjoyed the life in Edinburgh, so I decided to stay here and work for a local start-up company as a data analyst. 

I like Python the most! It's powerful, easy to read and object oriented as well. I think Web technology will change our life and play as more important role in the near future, especially for data visualization on the Web. Besides, I am using C# for some application development. Good for knowing .NET framework, but I don't like it quite much.
