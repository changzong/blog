Hi there! My name is Zong Chang. I grew up in a beautiful city in northern China. Then I got my engineering academic background in a wonderful univerisity(HIT). After four years of colurful life, I went to the United Kingdom and got my master degree in the University of Edinburgh, in data science and natural language processing. I really enjoyed the life in Edinburgh, so I decided to stay here and work for a local start-up company as a data analyst. I went back to China in Nov. 2015 for family reasons, and I'm working in a large company in HangZhou as a developer.

What's my job about? Basically, I am a data story teller. Provide me some data, structured or unstructured, relational databases or No-SQL JSON, with the latest backend and frontend technical skills, I turn it into interactive and pretty Web applications, and try to make the visualization reusable, customer oriented and information compact. Sometimes I wish to become a craftsman, and the data I have is the rock and wood in my hand, even though they have ugly appearance, with my cuttiing, polishing, and decoration, I will present the most beautiful side of them to my customers.

I like Python the most! It's powerful, easy to read and object oriented as well and has been the first choice among data scientists. Python is also good at buiding Web apps as backend language. I think Web technology will change our life and play as more important role in the near future, especially for data visualization on the Web. There are many powerful JavaScript frameworks and libraries today to create beautiful and high performance data driven Web pages, like AngularJS and React. Besides, NodeJS is a good option to use as backend but with JavaScript. D3JS, another smart JS library for making beautifully interactive graphs and charts from data. To deliver and deploy applications in fast way, Docker is my choice.

I was using WordPress themes to write blogs, but it's slow to open them in mainland China :) See [here](burninglizard.org)
